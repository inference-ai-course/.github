## 📝 Homework & Assignments

* Each week has a hands-on **homework assignment** posted in this repo.
* Homework tasks are designed to reinforce the lecture, using the newest open-source models and libraries (see `homework/` and `lecture_code/` directories).

**Homework Submission Workflow:**

1. **Create your own private repo by fork** (recommended: `MLE_HW_<yourname>`).
2. Complete all homework assignments in  **one single repo** .
3. When you finish each homework, **push your work** to your repo.
4. Create a pull request from your own forked repo. [What is Pull Request (PR)](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/about-pull-requests)
5. **Submit the link of Pull Request** via the Canvas Assignments section.
6. For each project milestone (see below), **create a new repo** and submit the link via Canvas.

## 🚀 Projects

**Course Project:**

Your project is to build a personalized research agent, applying all you’ve learned:

* Week 1: Project kickoff, define your agent’s goal
* Week 4: Project Insight I (peer/TA review of your idea)
* Week 7: Project Insight II (finalize scope and direction)
* Week 10: Final project demo—showcase your agent!

**Project Rules:**

* **All code must be in your own GitHub repo.**
* Submit your **project repo link** via Canvas when prompted.
* All submissions must be your own work—collaboration for discussion and Q&A is encouraged, but code must be original.

## 🗂️ Repo Structure

* `lecture_slides/` — PDF and PPTX slides for each week
* `lecture_code/` — Code walkthroughs and demo notebooks for lectures
* `homework/` — Homework assignment descriptions and starter code
* `project_guidelines.md` — Tips and requirements for the course project

---

## 📣 Community

* **Join the course Discord:** For Q&A, code sharing, project brainstorming, and peer support.
* **Peer Feedback:** Comment on at least two peers’ project ideas (via Discord or Canvas discussion).
* **MCP & Open Tools:** You’ll set up and experiment with tools like MCP (Model Context Protocol) and the latest open-source agents (LangChain, vLLM, etc).

---

## 🛠️ Submission Rules & Best Practices

* **Homework:**
  * Complete all tasks in one repo.
  * Submit via Canvas—**paste your GitHub repo link** for each week’s assignment.
* **Project:**
  * Each project phase (insight, final demo) requires a **separate repo** submission via Canvas.
* **Repo Organization:**
  * Use clear folders, commit messages, and documentation.
  * Cite all outside resources and credit all collaborators.
