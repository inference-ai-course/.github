## üìù Homework & Assignments

* Each week has a hands-on **homework assignment** posted in this repo.
* Homework tasks are designed to reinforce the lecture, using the newest open-source models and libraries (see `homework/` and `lecture_code/` directories).

**Homework Submission Workflow:**

1. **Create your own private repo** (recommended: `MLE_HW_<yourname>`).
2. Complete all homework assignments in  **one single repo** .
3. When you finish each homework, **push your work** to your repo.
4. **Submit the repo link** via the Canvas Assignments section.
5. For each project milestone (see below), **create a new repo** and submit the link via Canvas as well.

## üöÄ Projects

**Course Project:**

Your project is to build a personalized research agent, applying all you‚Äôve learned:

* Week 1: Project kickoff, define your agent‚Äôs goal
* Week 4: Project Insight I (peer/TA review of your idea)
* Week 7: Project Insight II (finalize scope and direction)
* Week 10: Final project demo‚Äîshowcase your agent!

**Project Rules:**

* **All code must be in your own GitHub repo.**
* Submit your **project repo link** via Canvas when prompted.
* All submissions must be your own work‚Äîcollaboration for discussion and Q&A is encouraged, but code must be original.

## üóÇÔ∏è Repo Structure

* `lecture_slides/` ‚Äî PDF and PPTX slides for each week
* `lecture_code/` ‚Äî Code walkthroughs and demo notebooks for lectures
* `homework/` ‚Äî Homework assignment descriptions and starter code
* `project_guidelines.md` ‚Äî Tips and requirements for the course project

---

## üì£ Community

* **Join the course Discord:** For Q&A, code sharing, project brainstorming, and peer support.
* **Peer Feedback:** Comment on at least two peers‚Äô project ideas (via Discord or Canvas discussion).
* **MCP & Open Tools:** You‚Äôll set up and experiment with tools like MCP (Model Context Protocol) and the latest open-source agents (LangChain, vLLM, etc).

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Submission Rules & Best Practices

* **Homework:**
  * Complete all tasks in one repo.
  * Submit via Canvas‚Äî**paste your GitHub repo link** for each week‚Äôs assignment.
* **Project:**
  * Each project phase (insight, final demo) requires a **separate repo** submission via Canvas.
* **Repo Organization:**
  * Use clear folders, commit messages, and documentation.
  * Cite all outside resources and credit all collaborators.
